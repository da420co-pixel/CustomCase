# Routes

TanStack Start uses **file-based routing**. Every `.tsx` file in this directory
is a route. Do **not** create `src/pages/`, `src/routes/_app/index.tsx`, or
`app/layout.tsx` — those are Next.js / Remix conventions. The only root layout
is `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

## Conventions

| File | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `index.tsx` | `/` |
| `about.tsx` | `/about` |
| `users/index.tsx` | `/users` |
| `users/$id.tsx` | `/users/:id` |
| `posts/{-$category}.tsx` | `/posts/:category?` |
| `files/$.tsx` | `/files/*` |
| `_layout.tsx` | layout route |
| `__root.tsx` | app shell |

`routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated. Don't edit it by hand.
